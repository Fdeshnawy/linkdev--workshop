    "content": "A15 entrepreneurial company announced it has invested millions of pounds in the leading R2S Logistics in Egypt, thereby enabling further growth and expansion of the e-commerce delivery field in Egypt. This investment is made for R2S Pre-Series A Round financing. R2S platform supports several e-commerce platforms through integrated logistical services including shipping, parcel delivery, receiving points, payment collection solutions, return and exchange management, warehouse management and fulfilment, as well as international shipping services to Egyptian merchants and startups. A15 said that R2S is adopting a distinct business model by becoming an Asset Light Business Model by expanding the geographical area of its services to cover all parts of the Republic through 11 shipping centres, in addition to more centres that will open soon. The annual R2S transaction volume and income growth also witnessed a noticeable boom, as the numbers showed 125% and 150% growth in turnover and income respectively. R2S, an innovative e-commerce logistics company, recently launched the R2S Plus platform, which connects a network of stores to e-commerce sites, to give customers more control over their shipping and delivery experience by enabling them to choose the closest receiving location, the best timing, and the payment method that suits them to receive their parcel. About 30% of online orders fail to reach their owners the first time, so the R2S success rate in delivering shipments is exceptional as it reaches 93%, which encouraged users to make more orders again with 75% of all users. On the other hand, R2S Plus retailers benefit from winning new or recurring customers as this increases the number of customers visiting their stores.\n\r R2S aims to expand its network of stores to 600 stores across the country before November 2020. Egypt and the Arab Gulf countries represent 80% of the volume of the e-commerce market in the MENA region, and this market continues to grow in sales by 30% annually and 100% in terms of packages shipped, which is twice the size of growth in the rest of the region.\r\n Egypt has become one of the fastest growing markets in the Middle East and North Africa, according to the latest report on e-commerce in the Middle East and North Africa issued by Google and Bain & Company. Mahdi Al-Olabi, founder and CEO of R2S, said A15 has extensive experience in e-commerce, as they have invested in e-commerce companies before, along with their contribution to building, developing, establishing and exiting companies operating in the same field. He added that the company will support our growth in our expansions that we aim to achieve by cooperating with more retail stores and e-commerce platforms in Egypt, which will enable us to perform more achievements and provide excellent services to a large customer base.",

    "title": "All the ways to watch Super Bowl 2022",
    "content": "Super Bowl 56 will occur this Sunday between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Los Angeles Rams. NFL's biggest event of the year is a television phenomenon that goes beyond just sports, be it million-dollar-commercials, the half-time concert or just an excuse to chow down on chicken wings. It used to be that the only way to watch was to either have a cable or satellite subscription, or venture out to your local sports bar. Fortunately, you now have a plethora of viewing options, including ways to stream. Where and when? Super Bowl 2022 will take place at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California on February 13th. The kick-off time is set for 6:30pm ET / 3:30pm PT. It'll be televised on NBC as well as Telemundo in Spanish. How to watch with cable or satellite TV Obviously, if you subscribe to either cable or satellite, you'll have no problem watching the Super Bowl this Sunday on your TV. This is good news if you'd rather not bother with signing up for a service online, or if you have a spotty internet connection. How to stream the Super Bowl Cord-cutters have plenty of ways to watch the big game this Sunday. One of them is through a live TV streaming service, as long as it carries NBC. Thankfully, a lot of them do. YouTube TV ($65/month), Hulu with Live TV ($65/month), DirecTV Stream ($70-plus/month), Sling TV ($35-plus/month) and Fubo TV ($65-plus/month) all include NBC. If you don't currently subscribe to any of these services and want to watch the game for free, you can sign up to one for a seven-day free trial period just to watch the game, and then cancel afterward. The exception is DirecTV Stream, which doesn’t offer free trials. Alternatively, you can also watch the game through Peacock’s Premium ($5/month) or Premium Plus tier ($10/month). You can also catch it on the NBC Sports app and NBCSports.com, but only if you’re already a subscriber through other means. The aforementioned services and apps are available through your phone or streaming devices such as Roku, Fire TV, Apple TV or Google TV. If you don't have pay-TV or a streaming service What if you don’t want to sign up for pay TV or a streaming service? Your options are unfortunately limited. You can either watch the game through the NFL Mobile app or the Yahoo Sports app. Of course, you could also use an indoor antenna with your TV to simply watch the free over-the-air broadcast. International viewers can use NFL's international game pass streaming service, which has a seven-day free trial. If you’d rather not go through that, however, check out this guide from the NFL to see if your country has a local Super Bowl broadcast partner. What about 4K? In 2020, Fox made history by broadcasting the Super Bowl in 4K and HDR for the first time (it was still shot in 1080p and HDR, but was upscaled to 4K in the broadcast). However, that is not an option this year. A spokesperson for NBC said that “The game will not be in 4K.” It did not give an official reason why.",

    "title": "Vizio's new 4K TVs start at $230",
    "content": "We got a peek at Vizio’s new 4K TVs at CES back in January, (Remember January? It was when we still went places and saw people) and now they’re closer to rolling out, complete with model numbers and prices. That includes the company’s first 4K OLED sets that promise a borderless aesthetic, and of course, the technology’s precision lighting control that provides deep blacks and excellent contrast. When the 65- and 55-inch OLEDs go on sale this fall they’ll cost $2,000 and $1,300, respectively. Compare that to LG’s BX series OLED that cost $2,200 and $1,500 in the same sizes, and you can see that a price war is coming... eventually. Those aren’t the only new sets Vizio has lined up either, and it’s promising to deliver 4K resolution, HDR support for multiple formats (Dolby Vision, HDR10+, HDR10 and HLG) as well as HDMI 2.1 inputs on the entire range. That goes from its top of the line $3,000 85-inch P-Series Quantum X all the way down to the 40-inch V-Series set that will sell for $230. As shown in their diagram, the TVs have varying levels of brightness and local dimming zones. The P-Series Quantum X includes a bezel-less design and all of the P-Series TVs include an extra anti-reflective coating. For the midrange M-Series, Vizio said that its 65- and 55-inch MQ8 models will include twice as many dimming zones as last year’s TVs, and they will be available exclusively via Amazon for $750 and $550, respectively. Top of the line TVs (everything except for the V-Series) will include Vizio’s Pro Gaming Engine that has support for Variable Refresh Rate (VRR), AMD FreeSync and 4K/120Hz input. Even on the cheaper models, eARC is included, but they should all have you well prepared for the PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles to arrive this fall. The V-Series TVs don’t specify an amount of LED backlighting, but for the price they’ll provide tough competition to value-oriented sets from the likes of TCL and Hisense. Once they hit shelves, a 40-inch model with 4K, HDR and HDMI 2.1 will cost $230, while the most expensive version is a planned 75-inch model for $800.",

    "title": "VR-related claims increased by 31 percent in 2021, says UK insurance firm",
    "content": "Meta’s Reality Labs VR division has yet to disclose how many Quest 2 headsets it has sold to date. What we do know is that it recently became more popular than ever. On Christmas Day 2021, the Oculus app hit the top of Apple’s App Store charts for the first time. The software achieved that milestone thanks to everyone who bought a Quest 2 headset to gift to their friends and loved ones. In another more amusing sign of just how popular VR headsets are becoming, insurer Aviva said last year it saw a 31 percent increase in home contents claims involving VR headsets and a 68 percent overall increase since 2016. In 2021, the average claim for VR-related accidental damages was about £650 or $880, and most incidents involved cracked TVs screens. “As new games and gadgets become popular, we often see this playing through in the claims made by our customers,” Kelly Whittington, Aviva’s UK property claims director, told The Guardian. “In the past, we’ve seen similar trends involving consoles with handsets, fitness games and even the likes of rogue fidget spinners.” Less than a month and a half into 2022, Aviva has already had to process a number of VR-related claims and the company expects more to come in throughout the year. That still doesn’t tell us how many VR headsets are out there. As far as the Quest 2 is concerned, the closest we have to a solid number is a third-party estimate Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon shared in November 2021. At the time, he said Meta had shipped approximately 10 million units of its latest VR headset. ",

    "content": "If you’re using Zoom on a Mac, now’s the time to make sure it’s updated to version 5.9.3. Zoom has acknowledged a bug that appears to cause the microphone on Macs running macOS Monterey to stay on even after leaving a meeting, first reported by The Register Users have been complaining about the issue since December, as documented in a post on Zoom’s community forum. Several users noticed that the orange recording indicator light in the Control Center appears when Zoom isn’t being used — the indicator light is a privacy feature introduced in Monterey that warns you when an application is using your microphone. This obviously raised some privacy concerns, given Zoom had a serious privacy vulnerability on Macs in the past. In 2020, the company was accused of misleading users about offering end-to-end encryption when it really didn’t at the time. “THIS BUG DID NOT RESULT IN AUDIO DATA BEING TRANSMITTED BACK TO ZOOM’S PLATFORM” A Zoom representative later commented on the post, stating Zoom “experienced a bug relating to the Zoom client for macOS, which could show the orange indicator light continue to appear after having left a meeting, call, or webinar.” The representative also noted that updating Zoom to version 5.9.3, which was released in late January, will fix the issue. Zoom first attempted to fix the bug in a December 5.9.1 update, as its release notes say Zoom “resolved an issue regarding the microphone light indicator being triggered when not in a meeting on macOS Monterey,” but it looks like this solution didn’t work for everyone.
